nc IP port            #Simple Banner grab  ?Does a simple connection to a server's service, just a "hi" and service talks back and gives us "its name"
nc -nv IP port        #Banner grab without DNS resolution (-n) better when working only with IPs and verbose (-v) for detailed output info
nc -lvnp port         #Listen on a port  ?-l puts on listen mode | -v verbose, so that we know when the connection is made | -n disable DNS resolution and connect only to raw IP to speed up connection | -p to specify the port next to it


```
