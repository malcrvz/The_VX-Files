# Vector auto-enumeration scripts

{% hint style="warning" %}
These auto-enumeration scripts will run many commands known for identifying vulnerabilities and create a lot of "noise" that may trigger anti-virus or security monitoring software that looks for these types of events. This may prevent the scripts from running or even trigger an alarm that the system has been compromised. \
\
In some instances, we may want to do a manual enumeration instead of running scripts.
