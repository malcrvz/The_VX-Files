# Downloaders and Launchers

#### Downloader

Malware seemingly innocent that will download automatically another greater malware into the system, since its already in the machine its harder for the detection systems to work as it could look as a legitimate user download. In coding terms it could be the part of the code that downloads malicious scripts or dependencies, tho it could refer as the same part on a legitimate program too.



#### Launcher

Small program, easy to pass undetected because of its structure that will launch another greater inactive malware already in the system. In coding terms it could be the part of the code that initiates the malware, tho it could refer as the same part on a legitimate program too.
