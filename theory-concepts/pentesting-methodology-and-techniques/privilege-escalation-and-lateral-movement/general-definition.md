# General definition

Usually when you compromise and gain access to a system its from a low privileged user account, because they are usually the easiest, but also limited, if the admin did a good work they won't have access to important data and it may seem like it was all for nothing, but that's where privilege escalation and lateral movement enters.&#x20;

Entering through the door ( or maybe more like through the broken window ;-) ) it's a big part, but not the end, privilege escalation is in fact one of the most important parts of the whole pentesting!\
Once inside we must see "what can we do with whats given" and try to reach as far as we can until we get the ideal result of full control of the system or even the network.

Privilege escalation is focused on obtaining the root/admin account (or even just an exploit to act like it) in a compromised system parting from a low-privileged user (escalation, going up!). \
While lateral movement is about seeing how many of the network systems can we access, control and exploit, while also trying to zig-zag our way into a privilege escalation (lateral, going sideways!).&#x20;
