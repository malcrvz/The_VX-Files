# General definition

Usually when you compromise and gain access to a system its from a low privileged user account, because they are usually the easiest, but also not the most useful, if the admin did a good work they will not have access to important data, but that's where privilege escalation and lateral movement enters.

Entering through the door ( or maybe more correct through the broken window ;) ) it's a big part, but not the end, this may not seem but its one of the most important parts of the methodology!\
Once inside we must see "what can we do with whats given" and try to reach as far as we can until we get the ideal of full control of the system or even the network!

Privilege escalation would be more focused on obtaining the root/admin access or even just an exploit to act like it in a compromised system parting from a low-privileged user(escalation, going up!), while lateral movement would be more about seeing how many of the network systems can we access, control and exploit, while also trying to zig-zag our way into root/admin (lateral, going sideways!).&#x20;
