# Spyware

Malware specifically designed to collect information about the user/organization without they knowledge or consent.\
The specific functions of a spyware may vary and they can be very sophisticated, but the most popular ones include keylogging, tracking internet browsing, collecting search history, accessing personal files, monitoring email messages or even record the webcam or microphone of the victim.

Spyware is often distributed through untrustworthy software download (trojan) or fraudulent emails and malicious links (phishing), and once installed it tries to operate covertly, making detectiong challenging. \
Once the criminal has enough data on the victim, he can then proceed to escalate the attack to black mailing, stealing money with stolen credentials, take full control of the system, impersonate the victim...
