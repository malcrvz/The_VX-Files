# Hacktool

Short for Hacking Tool, refers to a software used by cybersecurity specialists to perform penetration tests on a system. While its dangerous and could be damaging in the wrong hands, its used by professionals in a good and constructive manner (and let's not kid ourselves, bad actors too).\
So while they imitate or are technically malware (and the protection systems should trigger on sight), there had to be a friendlier name for the tools that pentesters use in good faith to make a living.



Here for a clear example you have the list of tools included in the Kali Linux distribution:
