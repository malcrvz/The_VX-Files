# Pretexting

A form of social engineering that involves creating a fabricated scenario and assuming a false identity to manipulate individuals into sharing sensitive information or taking unknowingly self-sabotage actions. While it is related to phishing and its usually done in conjunction, pretexting is more centered into tailoring a background story and can be executed through digital or real life mediums. It can even involve actors or voice actors.

Bad actors create a fake online persona, to deceive and manipulate individuals into a fake relationship. This scam gained popularity with the rise of online dating and social media. The goal is to gain the trust of the victim with fake promises and words of love, then asking for money with some sort of fabricated dire situation. Fake profiles can be done with minimal effort, be run by bots and be spammed all over the internet or be thorough and tailored to the interests of a particular victim.\
