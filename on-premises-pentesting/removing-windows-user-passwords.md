# Removing Windows user passwords

For this you need a toolkit USB loaded with a live CD tool as (deprecated, but still functional) "Hiren's Boot" or its spiritual successor (and loaded with tons of useful tools, very recommended!) "Medicat".

There's instructions/scripts to install them on a USB in their webs.

Once you boot the live CD there's a section with various password removal tools that edit the SAM file and let you change/remove the pass easily.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If live CD doesn't load directly and BIOS has a password meaning you can't change boot order, you would need to open the system and remove the CMOS battery located in the motherboard for a couple minutes, so the BIOS resets to default.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Be very careful when editing SAM files and never do it on production systems if there's other way, as it can corrupt the file and leave the account inaccessible!
